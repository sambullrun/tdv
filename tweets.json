    "Pro traders aren't any better at \"predicting\" where the market will go than a hobby trader, and its not the job. The difference is all in execution: Finding lvls, protecting profits once available, stopping out & adjusting when wrong, and consistant loss size control. Focus there",
    "All my trading is based on 3 simple setups:\n\n1) Bull and bear flags (basing patterns)\n\n2) Fake breakdowns (trendline or level is lost then recaptured - buy/sell the recapture)\n\n3) Buy rising trendlines, sell falling ones\n\nTakes years to \"master\", but provides a great foundation"
