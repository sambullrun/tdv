    "Pro traders aren't any better at \"predicting\" where the market will go than a hobby trader, and its not the job. The difference is all in execution: Finding lvls, protecting profits once available, stopping out & adjusting when wrong, and consistant loss size control. Focus there",
    "All my trading is based on 3 simple setups:\n\n1) Bull and bear flags (basing patterns)\n\n2) Fake breakdowns (trendline or level is lost then recaptured - buy/sell the recapture)\n\n3) Buy rising trendlines, sell falling ones\n\nTakes years to \"master\", but provides a great foundation",
    "My trading improved dramatically when I stopped focusing on the news, stopped focusing on macro analysis, stopped focusing on other peoples opinions, and just focused exclusively on a few simple price setups day in and day out. This kind of simplicity is hard to grasp at first",
    "After trading nearly 20 years, I've noticed a deep correlation between simplicity & profitability. When I started, I traded 10 markets, many setups, 5 indicators; & net lost. Year by year it shrank (& P&L grew) to now where I trade 1 market, mostly 1 setup, 1 indicator. Less=more",
    "The more years I spend trading, the less often I trade, and this directly translates into better performance. High quality patterns are rare by definition - to be able to sit through market ups & downs and do absolutely nothing until they appear is one of the most valuable skills"
